As mentioned in the description, this is purely for the betterment of my programming skills. This is my first "actual" project, and as such will be riddled with what you may call poor programming practices.

You can find well maintained documentation in the Wiki section.

Planned features:
Two large (10 square km) interconnected cities
  -Layout similar to the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula
Car AI
-Car accidents
-Emergency responders
-Traffic jams
Pedestrians
-Roadkill? (lol)
Drivable car (low priority)

Source files can be found in /src
If you want to fork this, you will have to download Ogre3D, Bullet, irrKlang, and RapidXML separately, and create your own project/solution. Unfortunately, no one will want to fork this. :(
