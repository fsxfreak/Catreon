        <h1>Catreon</h1>
        <p>A personal project written in C++ simulating vehicles interacting with stoplights, other vehicles, etc. Used for learning OOP, and getting experience with Ogre3D, irrKlang, Bullet, and Maya.</p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>As mentioned in the description, this is purely for the betterment of my programming skills. This is my first "actual" project, and as such will be riddled with what you may call poor programming practices.</p>

<p>You can find well maintained documentation in the Wiki section.</p>

<h2>Planned features</h2>

<p>Two large (10 square km) interconnected cities, with a layout similar to the San Francisco Bay Area Peninsula. A defining feature will be the Car AI, as it will drive the simulation. No humans are perfect, so car accidents will be possible, along with emergency responders, and traffic jams. Pedestrians will also be present to realistically simulate city driving. Lastly, I may include a drivable car, but it is not a priority.</p>

<p>If you want to fork this, you will have to download Ogre3D, Bullet, and irrKlang separately, and create your own project/solution. Unfortunately, no one will want to fork this. :(</p>

<h2>Some background information about me</h2>

<p>I'm 15 years old, living in the San Francisco Bay Area. I have been programming only in C++ since I was 13 years old, but have not done any major projects to date. Catreon will be my first programming project ever, and hopefully will serve as a bolster to my college application in the future.</p>
